"""
Source-level RSA using a searchlight
====================================

This example demonstrates how to perform representational similarity analysis
(RSA) on source localized MEG data, using a searchlight approach.

In the searchlight approach, representational similarity is computed between
the model and searchlight "patches". A patch is defined by a seed vertex on the
cortex and all vertices within a given radius. By default, patches are created
using each vertex as a seed point, so you can think of it as a "searchlight"
that scans along the cortex.

The radius of a searchlight can be defined in space, in time, or both. In
this example, our searchlight will have a spatial radius of 2 cm. and a
temporal radius of 20 ms.

The dataset will be the MNE-sample dataset: a collection of 288 epochs in which
the participant was presented with an auditory beep or visual stimulus to
either the left or right ear or visual field.

# Now that the epochs are in the proper order, we can create a DSM based on the
# experimental conditions. This type of DSM is referred to as a "sensitivity
# DSM". Let's create a sensitivity DSM that will pick up the left auditory
# response when RSA-ed against the MEG data. Since we want to capture areas
# where left beeps generate a large signal, we specify that left beeps should
# be similar to other left beeps. Since we do not want areas where visual
# stimuli generate a large signal, we specify that beeps must be different from
# visual stimuli. Furthermore, since in areas where visual stimuli generate
# only a small signal, random noise will dominate, we also specify that visual
# stimuli are different from other visual stimuli. Finally left and right
# auditory beeps will be somewhat similar.
