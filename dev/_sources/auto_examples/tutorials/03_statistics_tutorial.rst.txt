Tutorial part 3: statistical analysis of group-level RSA results
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial, we'll dive into cluster-based permutation testing for group-level
statistical analysis.

The statistical test is described in `Maris & Oostenveld, 2007
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.03.024>`__. This functionality is not part of
the MNE-RSA package, but rather MNE-Python, but it is a large part of a proper RSA
analysis so I figured any decent RSA tutorial should cover this.

Cluster-based permutation testing is becoming the standard “go-to” method for testing
for significant differences between experimental conditions in MEG and EEG studies.
However, applying the technique correctly is not always straightforward and there are a
lot of caveats to beware of. On top of this, the API of MNE-Python regarding these tests
could use a bit more work. (If you are inspired by this tutorial, could you `lend a hand
<https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/issues/4859>`__ with this? ❤)

The purpose of cluster-based permutation testing
------------------------------------------------

When exploring differences between conditions, a good first step is to perform separate
t-tests for each channel/sourcepoint/timepoint and visualize them. While this gives you
a good feel of where and when significant differences may occur, one cannot always make
solid statistical inferences based on these values. Cluster-based permutation testing is
designed to solve two problems that arise when using mass t-tests:

1. The multiple-comparisons problem: solved by using a cluster-based
   statistic
2. The non-Gaussian data problem: solved by using random permutations

The solutions to these problems come at a hefty price though: the test can only infer
the data is different between conditions. **The test can not be used to infer when and
where there is a significant difference.** Researchers get this wrong a lot. The
Fieldtrip manual even has a `dedicated page about this
<https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_not_to_interpret_results_from_a_cluster-based_permutation_test>`__
which I encourage you to read.

Now that I’ve scared you enough, let’s do this!

In the cell below, update the ``data_path`` variable to point to where you have
extracted the
`rsa-data.zip <https://github.com/wmvanvliet/neuroscience_tutorials/releases/download/2/rsa-data.zip>`__

Cluster permutation testing on a single channel
-----------------------------------------------

In the classic EEG event-related potential (ERP) literature, statistical
testing between two conditions was done by first identifying one or more
sensors and stretches of time that seem likely to hold a significant
difference, then averaging the signal across those sensors and time
region, followed by a single t-test or ANOVA test. Time would tell
whether the chosen channels and time region would replicate across
studies.

Let’s do this for our sensor-level RSA result that we obtained in
:ref:`tut-sensor-level`. I’ve ran the same analysis across multiple subjects and
placed it in the ``group_analysis`` subfolder of the data package you’ve downloaded.
Executing the call below will load them.

The “cluster” part of cluster permutation tests
-----------------------------------------------

In essence, the permutation cluster test automates what we’ve just done
above, but with a twist that we will get to later.

First, it must determine “clusters”, i.e. regions of interest where
there might be a significant difference between the conditions. We
eyeballed this based on the confidence interval of the mean, but the
algorithm must use some form of automated function. We can specify the
function that the algorithm should use, but it comes with a useful
default: a t-test: :func:`mne.stats.ttest_1samp_no_p`

.. warning
   The initial t-test (or whatever stat function you chose) is just to form clusters,
   it is not used to determine significance!

Let’s do this step manually first, so you get an understanding what is going on:

- First, we do the t-test for every timepoint.
- This is a t-test against 0. To perform a paired t-test, we test ``data_pixels -
  data_facenet``.
- Then, we set a threshold.
- Everything above the threshold becomes a cluster.
- We compute the sum of all the t-values inside the cluster.

Based on the figure above, a threshold value of ``2`` seems to obtain a reasonable
cluster. We could have chosen a different threshold, and there is no reason to choose
a threshold that corresponds to some p-value, other than perhaps providing a sensible
default value. The statistical function and the threshold used to form clusters are
completely up to the researcher. The idea here is to use your domain knowledge to
increase statistical power: when clusters “make sense” regarding to what we know about
the experimental setup and how MEG data behaves, we are likely to obtain better
p-values in the end.

The “permutation” part of the cluster permutation test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have our cluster, we can “permute” it to find what random clusters looks
like. In order to generate random clusters, we mix up the class labels. Read the code
in the cell below carefully to find out how this is done:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 233-252

.. code-block:: Python


    # Throw the data onto one big pile
    big_pile = np.vstack((data_pixels, data_facenet))

    # Shuffle the rows. This is what a "random permutation" means.
    np.random.shuffle(big_pile)

    # Divide again into the "pixels" and "facenet" conditions
    permuted_pixels, permuted_facenet = big_pile[: len(subjects)], big_pile[len(subjects) :]

    # Compute t-values, which should be nice and low
    permuted_tvals = ttest_1samp_no_p(permuted_pixels - permuted_facenet)

    # See what the clusters look like now
    permuted_cluster_tvals_sum = plot_cluster(
        permuted_tvals, threshold=2, data_cond1=permuted_pixels, data_cond2=permuted_facenet
    )
    print("Sum of t-values in cluster:", permuted_cluster_tvals_sum.round(3))

    Sum of t-values in cluster: 0.0




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 253-274

You can run the cell above multiple times to see what different permutations look
like. If it is very rare that we get a cluster with larger max t-value than the one we
found in the original data, we can say that there is a significant difference in the
original data. Finally, the percentage of times you find a larger max t-value in the
randomly permuted data is your p-value.

And that is the cluster permutation test!

So, with all of this in mind, we can now use the MNE-Python
:func:`mne.stats.permutation_cluster_1samp_test`
to perform everything we have done above in a single line of code. When
studying the line of code, keep the following in mind:

- Read the documentation of :func:`mne.stats.permutation_cluster_1samp_test` first!
- The first parameter, ``X`` is your data matrix (``n_participants x n_times``). Since
  we are using paired t-tests to define clusters, you need to set this to
  ``data_pixels - data_facenet`` like we did before
- The threshold to form clusters is ``2`` like we used before - We set ``tail=1`` to
  only look for positive t-values to mimic what we did before. You can also experiment
  with ``-1`` and ``0`` to look for clusters with negative t-values or both positive
  and negative.

Computing the p-value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the value of ``tail`` you used in your call to
:func:`mne.stats.permutation_cluster_1samp_test` you have either 1, 2, or 3 clusters
for this particular dataset. The clusters that your test found each have an associated
p-value.

- If the sum-of-t-values for the cluster was **positive**, then the p-value is the
  fraction of random permutations that produced a cluster which a sum-of-t-values that
  was equal or **greater**
- If the sum-of-t-values for the cluster was **negative**, then the p-value is the
  fraction of random permutations that produced a cluster which a sum-of-t-values that
  was equal or **smaller**

To understand this better, lets use the ``t_obs``, ``clusters`` and ``H0`` return
values that you produced above to compute this p-value ourselves to test our knowledge
of what these return values mean. We will:

- Loop over all the clusters you found
- Determine the ``sum_of_t_values`` inside the cluster
- Compute the fraction of ``H0`` whose absolute value is equal or larger than the
  absolute ``sum_of_t_values``

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 334-339

.. code-block:: Python


    print(f"The cluster p-values should be:\t{pvals}")
    our_pvals = [(H0 >= t_obs[cluster].sum()).mean() for cluster in clusters]
    print(f"Our manually computed cluster p-values are:\t{our_pvals}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    The cluster p-values should be: [0.04589844]
    Our manually computed cluster p-values are:     [np.float64(0.0458984375)]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 340-380

Interpreting the p-value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now comes the twist that I mentioned in the beginning. The final part of the cluster
permutation test is that you use the **smallest** cluster p-value as final outcome of
the test. You might be tempted to judge the significance of each cluster separately
based on its associated p-value, but that would be statistically incorrect.

.. warning
   The data inside a cluster was compared against random permutations of the dataset
   as a whole, not just the data inside the cluster. Hence, the test does not say
   whether a cluster by itself is statistically significant or not. The cluster
   permutation test only tells you whether the distribution of the data **as a
   whole** is significantly different between conditions. This is the price you pay
   to avoid the multiple comparisons problem.

So what can you do? `Sassenhagen & Draschkow
2019 <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.13335>`__ offer
some good advice. Personally, I would go for something like:

    The cluster-based permutation test revealed a significant difference
    between the conditions (p=SMALLEST_P_VALUE). This result was mostly
    driven by clusters at X (CLUSTER_PVAL) and Y (CLUSTER_PVAL), which
    correspond roughly to DESCRIPTION_OF_ROIS”.

Clusters across space and time
------------------------------

The formation of clusters becomes a bit more tricky in the case of
:class:`mne.SourceEstimate` objects, where data is defined across vertices in space as
well as samples in time.

In this case, the first order of business is to morph everything to a template brain,
so that the vertices are aligned. This is common practice in MEG group analysis, so
I’m not going to cover that process in this tutorial.

Instead, I have run the spatio-temporal RSA analysis that we did
:ref:`tut-source-level` across multiple subjects and placed the results in the
``group_analysis`` folder of your data package. Let’s load them and see if we can run
a spatio-temporal cluster-based permutation test (quite a mouthful).

Let’s proceed as before by first looking at the difference between the
means of the two conditions. A neat feature of the
:class:`mne.SourceEstimate`
class is that it supports common math operations such as ``+``, ``-``,
``*`` and ``/``. For example, computing the difference between the
``pixels`` and ``facenet`` RSA results of the first subject can simply
be computed as ``stc_diff = stc_pixels[0] - stc_facenet[0]``. In the
cell below, we compute the difference between the two conditions in a
pairwise manner for each subject, then compute the mean across the
pairwise differences.

The figure shows us clear differences between the pixel versus FaceNet
RSA scores across the visual cortex.

Let’s explore this difference with a t-value map. In order to compute t-values, we
need to pull the data out of the :class:`mne.SourceEstimate` objects. As before, since
we have a within-subject contrast between the two conditions, we want to perform
pairwise tests. So, as a first step, create a data array ``X`` of shape
``(n_participants x n_vertices x n_times)`` where each slice ``i`` along the first
dimension is the difference between ``stc_pixels[i].data - stc_facenet[i].data``. The
next step is running ``X`` through the :func:`mne.stats.ttest_1samp_no_p` function to
obtain t-values.

    from mne.stats import ttest_1samp_no_p

    X = np.array([stc1.data - stc2.data for stc1, stc2 in zip(stc_pixels, stc_facenet)])
    tvals = ttest_1samp_no_p(X)

    # Some sanity checks for our result
    assert X.shape == (16, 20484, 109), "Your `X` array has the wrong shape. 🤔"
    assert -0.17 < X.min() < -0.16, "Your `X` array does not have the correct values. 🤔"

Now we can pack the ``tvals`` into a new :class:`mne.SourceEstimate` object in order
to visualize them:

From this figure, it seems that setting a threshold of ``4`` may result in useful
clusters for our cluster-based permutation test. The function to perform the test in
both space and time is called :func:`mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_1samp_test`

But wait! Before you go and run the test, there’s two things we need to
take care of.

.. warning
   The order of the dimensions of ``X``, namely ``(n_subjects x n_vertices x
   n_samples)`` is not how :func:`mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_1samp_test` wants
   them. The function wants them as ``(n_subjects x n_samples x n_vertices)``. This is
   super unintuitive and everybody I know has gotten this wrong at least once. So,
   first we need to do ``X.transpose(0, 2, 1)`` to get the dimensions in the proper
   order. Please consider `helping us to improve the API
   <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/issues/4859>`__ and get this fixed.

The other thing to keep in mind is that in order to form clusters across the cortex,
we need to make sure that only neighbouring vertices are part of the same cluster.
This is a similar problem as we faced when computing searchlight patches in space
during our RSA analysis. The solution is found within the :class:`mne.SourceSpaces`
object that keeps track of the distances between source points. Since all of our data
has been morphed to the ``fsaverage`` template brain, we need to load the
:class:`mne.SourceSpaces` object for that brain. Then, we can compute the spatial
adjacency matrix from the :class:`mne.SourceSpaces` object through the
:func:`mne.spatial_src_adjacency` function.
