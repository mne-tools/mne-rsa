However, performing a searchlight analysis is a heavy computation that can\ntake a lot of time. Hence, we will also learn about the API regarding restricting the\nanalysis to parts of the data in several ways.\n\nIn the cell below, update the ``data_path`` variable to point to where you have\nextracted the [rsa-data.zip](https://github.com/wmvanvliet/neuroscience_tutorials/releases/download/2/rsa-data.zip)_\nfile to.\n"
